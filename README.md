This project aims to analyse cancer data in the United States for the year 2017, aligning with the goal of covering all phases of the data science pipeline.

To achieve this, I intend to use the following datasets and sources:

·       Kaggle Dataset: A CSV file containing cancer incidence data by state and various cancer types, such as Brain/Nervous System, Female Breast, Colon/Rectum, etc. This dataset includes missing values and requires profiling and quality improvement. This is the link to access the dataset (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bh9cBPgLJNwOaGoLEOjjFA69Ie8QqoLpY3s7kOJyRR0/edit?gid=468247514#gid=468247514)

·       Web Scraping: Supplementary data and statistics sourced from the American Cancer Society website (https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/all-cancer-facts-figures/cancer-facts-figures-2017.html#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20there%20will%20be,cancer%20deaths%20in%20the%20US).

 

The project pipeline will include the following phases:

·       Data Acquisition: Collecting data from the Kaggle dataset and integrating supplementary information through web scraping.

·       Data Storage: Structuring and organizing the data for seamless analysis.

·       Data Profiling: Examining missing values and exploring the characteristics of various variables, such as cancer types and their state-wise distribution.

·       Data Integration: Merging the Kaggle dataset with the scraped data to enrich our analysis.

·       Data Analysis: Conducting exploratory and statistical analysis to uncover patterns and trends.

·       Data Quality Improvement: Handling missing values and ensuring the dataset is cleaned and validated for reliable results.
